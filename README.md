# CSS Shadow Arrow Popup

This is a repository served using GitHub Pages demonstrating a CSS based popup with an arrow extending from its side
and with a drop shadow that takes the arrow into an account. It is based on the technique demonstrated in http://www.cssarrowplease.com/
where I personally took it from, but which is very general and well known among the CSS community and its precise origin is probably
unknown.

- [ ] Add variants with arrows on left, top and bottom
